In this Github Repository, we’re going to dive into experimenting about a project where we’re training a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model using 2D images of a sample area e.g. an office room. Our goal is to generate a 3D representation of the space, allowing users to explore the scene from various angles and create new views. This is an experiment which we are looking forward to explore and we will document our process, share insights, and present the results of the NeRF model training, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical audiences.
